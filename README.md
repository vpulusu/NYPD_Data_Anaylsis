## NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Historic) Research
### Data Source
DATA.GOV website(https://data.gov/)

The dataset comprises more than 20000 rows which incorporate Shooting information in New York from the year 2006 to 2019. This information is physically separated each quarter and evaluated by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning prior to being posted on the New York Police Department site. Each record addresses a shooting in New York City and incorporates data about the incident, the area, and the time of the incident. Moreover, data identified with the suspect and victim socioeconomics is likewise included. This information can be utilized to investigate the idea of shooting/crime incidents. A recent incident about the Atlanta Spa Shooting got me interested in examining this area. Investigating this informational index gives a ton of data about the shooting occurrences around the city of New York and information on being cognizant in explicit zones.
